# My own custom language

## Idea for this custom language
#### The idea for this language is to be able to write a language that's easy to learn, use and and highly customizable . 
#### The project has been interesting because I have learned a lot about how programming languages work and how to create one.
#### The language is not fully fledged, but I there is room to add more functionality to it.
#### As someone who comes from Africa knowing that I can create my own language is a big deal for me.
#### I hope to continue working on this project in the future and make it better as I have my own Tech Startup company (https://sputniktech.co) which I hope will be bigger in the future on the African continent and possibly globally.
#### So seeing Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon having their own programming languages. I hope to improve from what I've learned here and have a custom programming language for future big Sputnik Tech .

## How to test the language
#### The file extension for the language so far is .ss , it can change in the future.
#### To run this project I've created three test files which are: test.ss, test2.ss and testfunction.ss
#### Just `cd` into the AntlrCSharp directory and run `dotnet run` command in the terminal and the program will run the test.ss file, 
#### To run the other test files just change the running file in the `program.cs` on this line of code ` //var fileName = "Content\\testfunction.ss"; //var fileName = "Content\\test.ss"; var fileName = "Content\\test2.ss";` and run the `dotnet run` command again.
